# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)

## Process
### Setting up Database and Data Cleaning
* Setting up Database
  The database was set up in Postgresql using provided datasets. The following tables was created as a result:
  - products table
  - sales_by_sku table
  - sales_report table
  - analytics table and
  - all_sessions table
 
* Data cleaning
  - during importation, there were underlying table columns that made it difficult to extract the information. That was deleted using the queries provided in 'cleaning_data' section page.
  - similarly, all columns were given the 'text' data type for the ease of importation. They were converted to relevant data types as the project advanced
  - 
### Data Analysis 

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)
* Unmastered concepts such as CTEs, Ranks and Window Functions
When I reached out to the mentor whose explaination showed me that my initial approach was wrong, I figured I needed to apply concepts like CTEs, Ranks, and Window Functions which I have not mastered yet. This was a challenge to complete the fourth question.
* Short time
Because most of the time I spent carrying out researche on internet, the time of doing the actual coding was not enough. 
## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
* Do enough practice
The most challenge I found was to combine some SQL queries that I already know to solve a question. That is not easy and I strongly believe it is due to less practice so far.

* Keep seeking support from mentors and peers
I can't stress enough how easy it is to understand something when I am being pushed by an actual human being. Carrying out research is good, but it is easier to get lost.
