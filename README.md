## Process
### Setting up Database and Data Cleaning
* Setting up Database
  The database was set up in Postgresql using provided datasets. The following tables was created as a result:
  - products table
  - sales_by_sku table
  - sales_report table
  - analytics table and
  - all_sessions table
 
* Data cleaning
  - during importation, there were underlying table columns that made it difficult to extract the information. That was deleted using the queries provided in 'cleaning_data' section page.
